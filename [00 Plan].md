## Dog Cry - Outline

**Chapter 1: Shadow's Warning**

* **Setting:** 
    * A crumbling farmhouse nestled deep in the fog-choked hills of the Scottish Highlands. The garden is overgrown, a tangle of thorns and weeds, reflecting the neglect within. An oppressive silence hangs in the air, broken only by the relentless rain and the occasional creak of the house. The air tastes of damp earth and decay, a constant reminder of the secrets buried beneath the surface. 
* **Characters:**
    * **Agnes:**  A frail, elderly woman with haunted eyes. She lives a solitary life, haunted by a past she can't escape. She is both fierce and fragile, her sharp tongue masking a deep well of grief and pain.
    * **Shadow:**  An old, loyal shepherd dog, possibly deaf and partially blind. He is Agnes' only companion, his presence a source of comfort and security. He senses the shift in the atmosphere, growing restless and anxious, whimpering at the shadows and barking at the empty air. He is more than just a dog; he is a guardian, a protector, and a witness to the secrets that haunt the farmhouse.
    * **The Watcher:** An unseen presence that stalks the farm, a malevolent figure that whispers in the wind and casts long, unsettling shadows.  Their motives are unclear, but their presence is a constant source of dread. 
* **Plot:**
    * Agnes is awakened by a chilling howl, the sound of a dog crying out in pain. The cry lingers in the air, echoing her own unspoken grief.  She is plagued by unsettling dreams, waking to find Shadow whimpering at the foot of her bed, his eyes wide with fear. 
    * A series of strange events begins to disrupt Agnes's routine. Doors slam shut without explanation. Objects disappear and reappear in unexpected places. Shadow barks at empty corners, his whimpers filled with a sense of impending doom. 
    * Agnes begins to hear whispers in the wind, a low, guttural voice that seems to speak her name. She glimpses fleeting shadows in the corners of her vision, figures that vanish as quickly as they appear. 
    * As the mysterious presence grows bolder, leaving unsettling clues, Agnes is drawn deeper into her memories, forced to confront the tragedy that shattered her life. Flashbacks reveal the story of her young love, a forbidden romance that ended in a violent act, leaving her with a heavy burden of guilt and regret. 
* **Climax:**
    * The Watcher emerges from the shadows, their true form revealed as the ghost of the man Agnes loved and lost. He demands her confession, the truth he believes she's been hiding for years. 
    * Shadow, sensing the danger, launches himself at the ghostly figure, barking furiously, trying to protect Agnes. His actions, although futile, buy Agnes time to escape.  
    * Agnes, faced with her past, makes a choice: will she succumb to the weight of her secrets and embrace the darkness that haunts her, or will she fight for the chance at redemption?

And there is the stern minister, his sermons laced with pronouncements of judgment.
